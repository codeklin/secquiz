# Codebase Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup actions performed to remove unnecessary files and dependencies from the SecQuiz project.

## Files Removed

### Documentation Files
- `run-sql-updates.md` - SQL update instructions that are now covered in the migration guide
- `question-import-guide.md` - Question import instructions that are now outdated
- `topic-management-guide.md` - Topic management instructions that are now outdated
- `admin-features-guide.md` - Admin features documentation that is now outdated
- `freemium-feature-guide.md` - Freemium feature documentation that is now outdated
- `supabase-smtp-setup.md` - SMTP setup instructions that are now part of the migration guide

### Unused Code Files
- `src/pages/api/check-access.ts` - MongoDB-based access check API that is no longer needed
- `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` - Duplicate of NotFoundPage.tsx
- `tsconfig.app.json` - Redundant TypeScript configuration file

## Dependencies Removed

### Type Definitions for Removed Dependencies
- `@types/bcryptjs`
- `@types/cookie-parser`
- `@types/cors`
- `@types/express`
- `@types/express-session`
- `@types/jsonwebtoken`

### Development Tools No Longer Needed
- `concurrently` - Was used to run client and server concurrently
- `ts-node-dev` - Was used for server development

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Project Size**: Removing unnecessary files and dependencies has reduced the overall project size.

2. **Simplified Codebase**: The codebase is now more focused on the Supabase-only architecture.

3. **Improved Maintainability**: With fewer files and dependencies, the project is easier to maintain.

4. **Faster Installation**: Fewer dependencies means faster npm install times.

5. **Clearer Documentation**: Consolidated documentation makes it easier to understand the project.

## Next Steps

1. **Run npm install**: To update your node_modules folder with the removed dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Test Your Application**: Make sure everything still works as expected:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Deploy Your Application**: Deploy your cleaned-up application to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```
